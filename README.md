# Kakuro Solver

Kakuro is a number puzzle similar to crosswords but involves numerical constraints. This project implements an AI-based Kakuro solver using **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Backtracking**, and **Forward Checking** to efficiently solve Kakuro puzzles of varying difficulty.

## ✨ Features

- Loads Kakuro puzzles from JSON files.
- Uses different AI algorithms to solve puzzles efficiently.
- Comes with five sample puzzles, including one that has no solution.
- Measures algorithm performance through statistical analysis.

## 🧩 Problem Description

Kakuro is a number puzzle played on a grid where:

- Each blank cell needs a number between **1 and 9**.
- The sum of numbers in each row and column must match the target given in adjacent cells.
- A number cannot repeat within the same sum group.

## 🤖 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS) 🔍

DFS systematically explores possible number placements by diving deep into each configuration:

- Recursively assigns values until a valid solution is found or all options are exhausted.
- If constraints are violated, it backtracks and tries a new path.

**Limitations:**

- Can be slow for large or complex puzzles.
- Without proper cycle handling, it may explore redundant paths.

### 2. Backtracking 🔄

Backtracking tries to assign numbers step by step, reverting when necessary:

- Ensures only valid assignments are made at each stage.
- If an assignment leads to a conflict, it backtracks and attempts another number.

**Advantages:**

- Always finds a solution if one exists.

### 3. Forward Checking 🚀

Forward Checking enhances Backtracking by eliminating invalid choices early:

- Updates possible values for unassigned cells after each placement.
- If a cell runs out of valid numbers, it backtracks immediately.

**Advantages:**

- Shrinks the search space, making solving faster.

## 📥 Input Format

Puzzles are provided in **JSON format**, structured as follows:

```json
{
  "size": 5,
  "puzzle": [
    ["*", "*", 16, "*", 17],
    ["*", 3, "_", "_", "_"],
    [10, "_", "_", "_", "*"],
    ["*", "_", "_", "_", 6],
    [12, "_", "_", "_", "*"]
  ]
}
```

- `*` represents black cells (non-playable spaces).
- Numbers indicate the target sum for that row or column.
- `_` represents blank cells that need to be filled with digits.

Results clearly show that even though Forward checking has at most number of iterations, it solves Kakuro in the fastest way.
